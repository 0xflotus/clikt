# File copy sample

This example works like the `cp` command, copying files or directories.
It shows how to use `TermUi` to prompt the user for input.

Note that the gradle application plugin (and, by extension,
`runsamples`) will set the working directory to `samples/cp/`, so you
should use abolute paths, or build the distibution binary and use that.
